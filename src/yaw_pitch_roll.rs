//! Conversion between Quaternions and Euler angles (Yaw, Pitch, Roll)
//!
//! While quaternions are used internally for calculations, Euler angles are:
//! - More intuitive for humans to understand
//! - Directly correspond to physical rotations
//! - Commonly used in navigation and robotics
//!
//! The conversion process:
//! 1. Extracts gravity vector from quaternion
//! 2. Calculates angles using arctangent (atan2) functions
//! 3. Returns angles in radians (-π to π range)

/// Represents orientation as three angles in radians.
///
/// The angles describe rotations around three axes:
/// - Yaw: Rotation around Z (vertical) axis, like shaking head "no"
/// - Pitch: Rotation around Y axis, like nodding head "yes"
/// - Roll: Rotation around X axis, like tilting head toward shoulder
///
/// Note: These angles can experience gimbal lock when pitch approaches ±90°
