//! MPU9250 I2C Address Configuration
//!
//! The MPU9250 uses I2C for communication and can be configured with
//! one of two 7-bit addresses:
//! - 0x68 (default, AD0 pin low)
//! - 0x69 (alternate, AD0 pin high)
//!
//! This allows two MPU9250 devices to be used on the same I2C bus.
//! The address is selected by connecting the AD0 pin to either:
//! - GND for address 0x68
//! - VCC for address 0x69

/// Represents an MPU9250 I2C address.
///
/// The address is determined by the AD0 pin:
/// - When AD0 is connected to GND: 0x68 (default)
/// - When AD0 is connected to VCC: 0x69
///
/// Note: These are 7-bit addresses. Some I2C implementations may
/// require left-shifting by 1 to create the 8-bit address.
