//! MPU9250 Digital Low-Pass Filter Configuration
//!
//! The digital low-pass filter (DLPF) reduces noise in sensor readings by:
//! - Filtering out high-frequency vibrations
//! - Smoothing rapid changes in sensor data
//! - Reducing aliasing effects
//!
//! Filter selection involves balancing:
//! - Noise reduction (higher filtering)
//! - Response time (lower filtering)
//! - Power consumption
//! - Output data rate

/// Digital low-pass filter configurations.
///
/// Each filter setting provides different:
/// - Bandwidth (Hz): How much high-frequency data passes through
/// - Delay (ms): How long it takes for changes to be reflected
/// - Noise reduction: How much sensor noise is filtered out
///
/// Based on values from the official register map [RM-MPU-6000A](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Register-Map1.pdf).
