//! DMP Firmware Loader for MPU6050
//!
//! The Digital Motion Processor (DMP) is a programmable processor inside the MPU6050 that:
//! - Offloads complex motion processing algorithms from the main processor
//! - Provides more accurate sensor fusion and motion tracking
//! - Reduces power consumption by handling processing on-chip
//! - Enables advanced features like quaternion calculations and gesture detection
//!
//! This module handles loading the DMP firmware into the sensor's program memory.
//! The process involves:
//! 1. Writing the firmware data in chunks to the sensor's memory banks
//! 2. Booting the firmware to start DMP operation
//! 3. Configuring DMP features as needed
